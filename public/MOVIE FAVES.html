        This is the 2nd film by Shinkai Makoto that I have ever seen, following <i>"Your Name"</i>, which got me obsessed with his work. One of my favorite things about this film is the OST title track, <i>"Suzume"</i>, as performed by RADWIMPS ft. Toaka. It really puts me in an indescribible space of imagination. 👫🗝️
    
        <h2>Spy x Family: Code White (<i>2023</i>)</h2>

            This film is the first feature-length film of an anime show I enjoy. There are currently two seasons of this show and it's very entertaining to watch. I always enjoy the facial expressions illustrated in this show. They make me laugh really hard. 🤵🏼👧🏼👰🏻‍♀️🐶

            This film is an absolute work of art and is the first of all Shinkai Makoto films I've seen. I've definitely enjoyed Studio Ghibli works such as <i>"Princess Mononoke" — but I resonate with the conceptual nature of Shinkai's work moreover. 👫</i></p><br>
