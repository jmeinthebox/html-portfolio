<h1>About Me:</h1>
Welcome!
<p>
My name is Jaime Chan and I'm a web developer. I am also a Photographer with nearly 20 years of experience. I also am a Creative Director, Art Director, and Image Consultant.</p>

<p>I live in the Orange County, very close to Los Angeles County to where I serve both counties predominantly but also book clients and projects worldwide.</p>

<p>I am currently focused primarily on web development and seeking a full-time career in full-stack development. I am currently learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but will eventually take on other languages such as Python, C++, as well as other platforms that can be used to design and build apps.</p>


<p>With my background knowledge in imaging, I may especially prove useful in front-end design, UI, or anything visually related as I know not only how to format and position images, but to also give consultation about the subject matter of said images that belong on web pages.</p>

<p>I hope to be able to work with you on your web development and/or imaging needs and to make exciting projects that will help you reach your goals.</p>

<p>Please don't hesitate to reach me! My contact info is <a href="./CONTACT INFO.html">here</a>.</p>
Cheers!
